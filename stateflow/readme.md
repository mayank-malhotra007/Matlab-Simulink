# Stateflow

Stateflow is a matlab-simulink toolbox designed to model and simulate state machines and flow charts graphically.
- create finite state machines, control logic, event driven systems
- build states, transitions between states, actions, events 
- model complex logic, like mode switches, safety controllers, protocols, user interfaces
- integrates with simulink
- is visual and intuitive 
- generate code for embedded systems
